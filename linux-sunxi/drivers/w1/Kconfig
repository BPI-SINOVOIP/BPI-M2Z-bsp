	---help---
	  Dallas' 1-wire bus is useful to connect slow 1-pin devices
	  such as iButtons and thermal sensors.

	  If you want W1 support, you should say Y here.

	  This W1 support can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called wire.

	--- help ---
	  This allows to communicate with userspace using connector. For more
	  information see <file:Documentation/connector/connector.txt>.
	  There are three types of messages between w1 core and userspace:
	  1. Events. They are generated each time new master or slave device found
		either due to automatic or requested search.
	  2. Userspace commands. Includes read/write and search/alarm search commands.
	  3. Replies to userspace commands.

       --- help ---
               This adds a way to register a platform device for 1-wire bus.
               It introduces a new section "[w1_para]" in the FEX to configure the
               GPIO pin number used for the bus, with the attribute named "gpio".
               The GPIO pin must also be defined in the "[gpio_para]" section.

               1-wire device can then be accessed using the w1-gpio driver.

               Example configuration :
               [w1_para]
               gpio = 3

               [gpio_para]
               gpio_used = 1
               gpio_num = 3
               ...
               gpio_pin_3 = port:PH7<0><default><default><0>

               It is also possible to configure the GPIO pin number with the
               module paramerer "gpio". In this case, if the pin is valid,
               it will be used instead of what is configured in the FEX script.
