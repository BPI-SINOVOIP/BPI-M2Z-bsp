config PHY
	bool "PHY Core"
	depends on DM
	help
	  PHY support.

	  This framework is designed to provide a generic interface for PHY
	  devices. PHY devices are dedicated hardware that handle the physical
	  layer of the protocols in the OSI model.
	  PHYs are commonly used for high speed interfaces such as Serial-ATA
	  or PCI express.
	  The API provides functions to initialize/deinitialize the
	  PHY, power on/off the PHY, and reset the PHY. It's meant to be as
	  compatible as possible with the equivalent framework found in the
	  linux kernel.

config SPL_PHY
	bool "PHY Core in SPL"
	depends on DM
	help
	  PHY support in SPL.

	  This framework is designed to provide a generic interface for PHY
	  devices. PHY devices are dedicated hardware that handle the physical
	  layer of the protocols (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model).
	  PHYs are commonly used for high speed interfaces such as Serial-ATA
	  or PCI express.
	  The API provides functions to initialize/deinitialize the
	  PHY, power on/off the PHY, and reset the PHY. It's meant to be as
	  compatible as possible with the equivalent framework found in the
	  linux kernel.

config PHY_SANDBOX
	bool "Sandbox PHY support"
	depends on SANDBOX
	depends on PHY
	help
	  This select a dummy sandbox PHY driver. It used only to implement
	  the unit tests for the phy framework

config NOP_PHY
	bool "NOP PHY driver"
	depends on PHY
	help
	  Support for a no-op PHY driver (stubbed PHY driver).

	  This is useful when a driver uses the PHY framework but no real PHY
	  hardware exists.

config SPL_NOP_PHY
	bool "NOP PHY driver in SPL"
	depends on SPL_PHY
	help
	  Support for a no-op PHY driver (stubbed PHY driver) in the SPL.

	  This is useful when a driver uses the PHY framework but no real PHY
	  hardware exists.

config PIPE3_PHY
	bool "Support omap's PIPE3 PHY"
	depends on PHY && ARCH_OMAP2PLUS
	help
	  Support for the omap PIPE3 phy for sata

	  This PHY is found on omap devices supporting SATA such as dra7, am57x
	  and omap5

config SPL_PIPE3_PHY
	bool "Support omap's PIPE3 PHY in SPL"
	depends on SPL_PHY && ARCH_OMAP2PLUS
	help
	  Support for the omap PIPE3 phy for sata in SPL

	  This PHY is found on omap devices supporting SATA such as dra7, am57x
	  and omap5

config STI_USB_PHY
	bool "STMicroelectronics USB2 picoPHY driver for STiH407 family"
	depends on PHY && ARCH_STI
	help
	  This is the generic phy driver for the picoPHY ports
	  used by USB2 and USB3 Host controllers available on
	  STiH407 SoC families.
